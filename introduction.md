#### 빛 고르기와 지속가능한 디자인

빛 고르기(daylighting)는 건물 내부와 주변에 비치는 자연채광을 조절하는 방법입니다. 이 정의는 일조(daylight)에서 파생되었고, 지구를 떠도는 직사광과 산란광이 반사, 확산, 투입(?) 또는/그리고 블럭(?)되는 일련의 과정을 통해 사용자가 요구하는 빛을 얻게 되는 과정을 함축합니다. 2장에서 논의되고 있는, 사용자의 편안함과 건강을 위해 전기 빛과 뒤이은 냉방 부하

> Daylighting and Sustainable Design. 
 
> Daylighting is the controlled use of natural light in and around buildings. 
> The term is a derivate of the noun *daylight* and implies a process by which direct sunlight and diffuse daylight are reflected, scattered, admitted and/or blocked to achieve a desired lighting effect. As discussed in chapter 2, the benefits of daylighting range from reducing energy consumption for electric lighting and subsequent cooling loads to improving occupant comfort and health, a view to the outside and enhanced design aesthetics. At the same time there are dangers associated with admitting too much daylight into a building such as overheating, glare and lack of privacy. Balancing these effects requires careful design. 
 
> Given that any nonopaque element in a building envelope "daylights" the building's interior, the concept of daylighting is as old as architecture itself. The role of daylight being the default daytime lighting solution for building interiors remained mostly unchallenged until the widespread deployment of affordable fluorescent light from the early 1940s onwards. The introduction of affordable electric lighting and mechanical ventilation allowed floor plan depths to grow and windows - being freed from having to provide light and fresh air - could instead serve other architectural needs from design aesthetics to views. Daylighting became ispensable. The climax of this development may have been the windowless classrooms from the late 1960s, which were specifically designed to prevent students from being "distracted" by views to the outside.
